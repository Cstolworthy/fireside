"""Fetch backends for host-owned egress. See docs/SOURCE-CONTRACT.md.

A source names a backend, never a client library. Each backend hides its own
dependency here, so the core carries no vendor vocabulary and swapping a client
touches exactly one file.

  plain    stdlib urllib. The default; no third-party dependency.
  browser  presents a browser TLS/HTTP fingerprint, for sites whose bot check
           grades the ClientHello rather than the request.

Every backend has the same shape:

    fn(url, headers, limit, timeout, opts) -> text    (raises on failure)

`opts` is the source's declared transport dict. A backend reads the keys it
knows and ignores the rest, so the generic policy (headers, retries, backoff,
timeout) lives in the host while a backend's own knobs live here.
