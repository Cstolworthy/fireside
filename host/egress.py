"""Host-owned HTTP egress for sources. See docs/SOURCE-CONTRACT.md.

The plugin never opens a socket. It calls the `fetch` the host hands it; the host
attaches the credential (only to hosts the source declared), and logs every
request. This module is that fetch, plus the credential-scoping check.

Transport (added v1.10): some sites gate on the TLS ClientHello, not on routing.
A source that hits one of those declares `transport()`, which names a fetch
`backend` (see _backends.py) plus generic policy -- headers, retries, backoff,
timeout. The host performs the fetch through this one logged path, still with
the cookie attached only to declared hosts. The source owns the quirk; the host
owns the socket, the credential, and the choice of client.
