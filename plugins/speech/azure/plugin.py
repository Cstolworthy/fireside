"""v2 speech plugin: azure. The v1 implementation behind the v2 contract.

The proven v1 object is unchanged, plus the default quote/report and an adapter
that coerces the v1 Audio (.bytes) into a host.contracts.Audio (.data). The
plugin tree is what the host discovers; nothing above host/pluginhost.py imports
a plugin by name.

Resale (docs/PRICING.md): a connection can be the designated SALE connection,
where its voices are resold as character capacity. The config screen gains two
fields - the markup over cost and a per-1M-chars infra fee - and this plugin
becomes the sole authority on the sale rate and on how many characters a payment
buys. The host never sees a rate: it holds a per-user character balance, holds
the estimated characters before a run, and applies the plugin's reported count
after. `sale` on the quote/report context is what tells the plugin the run is
metered; every other run is pass-through and quotes the raw provider rate.
